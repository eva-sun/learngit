# how to add folder in github
## Log in to your GitHub and go to the repository you want to create a folder for
## Click "Create new file"
## Enter the name of the folder you want to create (at this point we're actually creating a file rather than a folder)
## Then when we press a "/" then directory becomes a folder
## In the last step (because github does not allow the creation of empty folders) we need to create a file in the new folder, any file type is ok
## After creating the file, pull to the end and click "Commit new file"
